Hello everyone,
My name is Bill. I've been developing and implementing WordPress websites for the past few years in a sort of semi-professional manner. After a two year break during which I've been doing portrait photography, I've jumped back into WP development. But this time I've decided to get on a pro-track and creating and working with github and version control and filling in lots of gaps that a self-learner typically misses.


That's all for now.
